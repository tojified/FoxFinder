FoxFinder
=========

This is an android activity (app) for drawing antenna patterns from a rotating antenna.  
The rotator and radio are controlled with PIC chips and android talks to the PICs via a 
Bluetooth serial adaptor.

The com.ulatoski.foxfinder.radio.emulated is a file which provides a stream of data similar
to the radio control unit.
